# taverns-towers

This is a work-in-progress repo. As a person who does a lot of creative writing, world building, and sitting at TTRPG tables, I've often scrambled to generate names for towns or citiies and populate it with locations of interests--shops, taverns, landmarks, and so on. Figuring out what was being sold, for how much, notable NPCs, and so on became sporadic messes for note-keeping. I'm making this app with the following goals: 

* Allow GMs and writers to have one place for location-related information
* Maintain a list of settlements (towns, cities, and so on), with optional relevant details (settlement size, leadership, important notes, etc.)
* Maintain a sub-list of locations associated with that settlement, with optional details that are relevant by type of location (places that sell things would have the ability to track things for sale, and so on)
* Add a map with pins for locations, for visual reference
* Filter locations by tags/categories
* Possibly more features!

This readme file will be a living document as this app grows. For right now, I don't have much to add to this document, as the app is not ready for others to consume. Check back regularly for more details and updates!
